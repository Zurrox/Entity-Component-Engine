[~] Collisions:
  [/] Broad Collisions
  [ ] Narrow Collisions(Need to do circle with rectangle)
[ ] Game States (Main menu state, game state etc)
[~] Maybe a Game class or something (GameWindow?) for games to use, provide an Update, Render & Initialize loop:
  [/] GameWindow
  [ ] Update & Render Loop
  [ ] Initialize Method
[ ] Catch duplicate events
[ ] Multithreading with events
[ ] JavaDocs
[ ] Differentiating between mouse buttons in MouseClickEvent
============================================
============================================
[ ] Keycode to Name? Don't exactly need this as programmers can compare the event.keyCode to KeyCode.VK_W
[ ] Maybe something in JSON to automate creation of some Entities
[ ] Localization?
[ ] Networking


TODO
Double Buffering
Multithreading
New Blueprint class? Just to make new entities, doesn't store the ID so it randomly generates them
Test Dependency System
Breakout
Circle Rendering
~Sprite Rendering
Narrow Circle to Rectangle Collisions
Stop double Events for each Collision
~Sound System
~Animation System
~Update System


NEED
[/] Double Buffering
[/] Circle Rendering
[/] Catch duplicate Events for Collisions (Each Collider will see the Collision so will send
the Event -> Could have an EventQueue or something which holds the Events sent
in the current tick, so can check if an event with the same two Colliders has already
been sent previously(Just the opposite way around)) -- Maybe done now. Queue is sent at the end of every update frame
[~] Breakout
[/] Differentiating between buttons in MouseClickEvent(Just needs to hold a variable)
[ ] GameState system
[ ] ~Multithreading -> Mainly for Events to be faster.
[ ] ~Maybe a ShapeRenderComponent class which can take any shape?
